# PRODIGY_DS_02
Performed  Data cleaning and Exploratory data analysis(EDA) on Diwali sales dataset.
As an Intern, I have created and completed in 5-7 days in Jupyter Notebook as per the task of Prodigy InfoTech i.e., DATA SCIENCE ----TASK 2.

### Task :
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
### Project overview:
In this project, we aim to analyze Diwali sales data to uncover trends, customer preferences, and buying patterns during the Diwali season. The analysis includes:
Cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore the relationships between variables such as product categories, customer demographics, and sales figures.
### Data sources:
https://github.com/rishabhnmishra/Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis/commit/9ecf9e09ff3c7f9420e348269321bcfbdbc0abe8
### Tools
Jupyter notebook
Make sure you have the following packages installed before running the project
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is an important step to ensure the data is consistent, complete, and ready for analysis. The cleaning process includes:
Handling missing values: Filling or removing missing data where necessary.
Removing duplicates: Ensuring no redundant data exists in the dataset.
Fixing data types: Converting columns to appropriate data types.
Outlier detection: Identifying and handling any outliers that may affect the analysis.

### Exploratory data analysis
EDA is the process of visually and statistically summarizing the dataset to find patterns and trends. Key steps include:
Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual variables like sales distribution, top-selling products, and customer demographics.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between multiple variables such as sales vs. customer age, sales trends over time, or product categories vs. customer gender.
Visualization: Using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create visual insights from the data.

### EDA techniques:
Count plot
Scatter plot
Bar plot

### Insights:
After completing the data cleaning and EDA process, some valuable insights which I found are:
-1:No.of female buyers are higher than male and females spent more amount purchasing.
-2:Most buyers are from age group 26-35
-3:Uttar pradesh has highest no. of Orders and has highest Amount spent by customers.
followed by Maharashtra,Karnataka.
-4:from above graphs, we can see that most buyers are married(women) and have high purchasing power.
-5: from above graphs we can see that , most of buyers are from IT sector,Healthcdare, Aviation sector
-6:From above graphs we can say that, most of the sold products are from Food,Clothing & Apparel, Electronic & gadgets
-7: from above graphs we can see that most of sold products are from Food,Clothing & Apparel & Electronics category.

### Conclusion:
Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP,Maharashtra , Karnataka working in IT sector,Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food,Clothing and Electronics category.
